# System Patterns: Nebula Engine

## 1. Core Architecture

*   **(To Be Defined):** High-level structure (e.g., Monolithic, Modular, Microkernel).
*   **Primary Architectural Pattern:** Entity-Component-System (ECS). This choice prioritizes data-oriented design, composition over inheritance, and aims for better performance and cache locality by separating data (Components) from logic (Systems).

## 2. Rendering Pipeline

*   **Target:** Leverage Flutter's `dart:ui` and potentially Impeller directly for rendering.
*   **(To Be Defined):** Abstraction layer over Flutter's rendering primitives.
*   **(To Be Defined):** Handling of 2D (batching, atlases) and 3D (mesh processing, shader management) specifics.
*   **(To Be Defined):** Material and Shader system design.

## 3. Scene Management

*   **World/EntityManager:** Manages entities (simple IDs) and their associated components. Efficient querying of entities based on their components is crucial.
*   **Component Storage:** Components (plain data objects) will be stored efficiently, likely in contiguous memory structures (e.g., lists or typed data arrays) grouped by type for cache-friendly access by Systems.
*   **Systems:** Contain the game logic (e.g., MovementSystem, RenderSystem, PhysicsSystem). Systems query the EntityManager for entities possessing specific component combinations and operate on those components' data. Systems are orchestrated by the game loop.

## 4. Asset Management

*   **(To Be Defined):** Strategy for loading, caching, and accessing assets (textures, models, shaders, audio).
*   **(To Be Defined):** Supported asset formats.

## 5. Physics Integration

*   **(To Be Defined):** Design for integrating external 2D/3D physics engines (e.g., Forge2D, custom solutions). Abstract interface vs. direct integration.

## 6. Concurrency & Performance

*   **(To Be Defined):** Use of Isolates for heavy computations (physics, AI, asset loading).
*   **(To Be Defined):** Memory management patterns.
*   **(To Be Defined):** Performance profiling and optimization strategies.

## 7. Extensibility

*   **(To Be Defined):** Plugin or extension system design. How users can add custom features or integrations.
