# Project Brief: Nebula Engine

## 1. Overview

Nebula Engine is envisioned as a high-performance, modern game engine built using Dart and leveraging the Flutter framework. It aims to provide comprehensive support for both 2D and 3D game development, offering capabilities that meet or exceed existing solutions like the Flame engine and aspire to parity with features found in libraries like Three.js.

## 2. Core Goals

*   **High Performance:** Utilize Flutter's latest rendering engine (Impeller/Skia NG) and employ efficient architectural patterns to deliver top-tier performance.
*   **2D & 3D Support:** Offer a unified API and robust feature set for both 2D and 3D graphics rendering and game logic.
*   **Flutter Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the Flutter ecosystem for UI, platform features, and tooling.
*   **Developer Experience:** Provide a clear, intuitive, and powerful API that is well-documented.
*   **Community Standard:** Aim to become a leading choice for Dart/Flutter game development.

## 3. Key Deliverables

*   Core Engine Library (Published on pub.dev)
*   Comprehensive API Documentation (Hosted on GitHub Pages)
*   Example Projects/Demos
*   CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) for testing, documentation generation, and publishing.

## 4. Target Audience

*   Dart/Flutter developers looking to build games.
*   Developers seeking a performant alternative to existing Dart game engines.
*   Developers familiar with engines/libraries like Unity, Godot, Flame, or Three.js who are exploring the Flutter ecosystem.

## 5. High-Level Scope

*   **Rendering:** 2D (Sprites, Shapes, Tilemaps), 3D (Meshes, Materials, Lighting, Shaders).
*   **Scene Management:** Scene graph, entity-component system (ECS) or similar architecture.
*   **Physics:** Integration points for 2D/3D physics libraries.
*   **Input:** Handling user input across platforms.
*   **Assets:** Loading and management of textures, models, audio, etc.
*   **Tooling:** Basic tooling or integration points for editors/debuggers.
*   **Documentation:** API reference, tutorials, guides.
*   **Deployment:** Publishing pipeline.
