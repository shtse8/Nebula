# Product Context: Nebula Engine

## 1. Problem Space

*   Existing Dart/Flutter game engines (like Flame) might have limitations in 3D capabilities or performance for highly demanding games.
*   Developers wanting to leverage Flutter's cross-platform capabilities for games need a robust, modern engine.
*   Lack of a single, dominant engine in the Flutter ecosystem that comprehensively covers both 2D and 3D with high performance.

## 2. Vision & Solution

*   Nebula Engine aims to be the go-to, high-performance 2D/3D game engine for the Flutter ecosystem.
*   It will provide a feature set comparable to established engines/libraries in other ecosystems (e.g., Three.js for 3D on the web) but tailored for Dart and Flutter.
*   Leverage Flutter's rendering advancements (Impeller) for optimal performance.

## 3. Target User Experience

*   **Intuitive API:** Easy to learn for developers familiar with game engine concepts, yet powerful enough for complex projects.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Feels like a natural extension of the Flutter framework.
*   **Performance Transparency:** Clear guidelines and tools for optimizing game performance.
*   **Excellent Documentation:** Makes it easy for developers to get started and master the engine.

## 4. Key Differentiators (Aspirations)

*   Superior performance leveraging Flutter's latest rendering pipeline.
*   Unified and strong support for both 2D and 3D development paradigms.
*   Tight integration with Flutter's widget system and platform channels where beneficial.
