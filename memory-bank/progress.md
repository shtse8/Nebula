# Progress: Nebula Engine (3D Rendering Foundation)

## 1. What Works

*   Core Memory Bank documentation files created and populated.
*   Flutter package (`nebula_engine`) created.
*   Basic `lib/src/` directory structure established.
*   **ECS Architecture Adopted & Implemented:**
    *   `World`, `Entity` (ID), `Component` base, `System` base classes created and exported.
    *   Basic ECS interactions tested (`test/nebula_engine_test.dart`).
*   **Core Loop:** Game update loop driven by `Ticker` within `GameWidget`.
*   **Rendering:**
    *   `Renderer` interface updated (`drawSprite`, `setCamera`, `drawVertices` added); `NebulaRenderer` implementation updated.
    *   `RenderSystem` updated to query/draw `SpriteComponent`s applying transforms (position, rotation, scale). Added `Camera` integration.
    *   `GameWidget` created using `CustomPaint` and `Ticker` to host engine and drive rendering/updates.
    *   Basic `Camera` class created and exported.
    *   Basic 2D rendering pipeline (sprites with transforms) confirmed working via example app.
*   **Components:**
    *   `TransformComponent` created and uses base `vector_math`.
    *   `SpriteComponent` created and exported.
*   **Dependencies:** `vector_math`, `forge2d` (^0.14.0) added and fetched.
*   **Physics:**
    *   `Forge2DPhysicsWorld` wrapper created; `vector_math` types corrected.
    *   Physics components created, exported, and use base `vector_math`.
    *   Initial `PhysicsSystem` created and exported.
    *   Physics update logic remains commented out due to persistent, unresolved build errors.
*   **Input:**
    *   `InputManager` state implemented.
    *   `InputSystem` created and exported.
    *   `GameWidget` updated with `Focus` and `Listener` for input capture.
    *   `PlayerControlSystem` created in example to use input.
    *   Input capture and entity control via input confirmed working (tested on Chrome).
*   **Assets:** `AssetManager` updated with image loading/caching/disposal logic.
*   **Example App:** Created, configured, updated to load/display sprites and test input control.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   **3D Rendering Implementation:**
    *   Define `MeshComponent` (vertex data, indices, etc.).
    *   Implement `Renderer.drawVertices` logic, including applying camera and model transformations (MVP matrix).
    *   Update `RenderSystem` to query for and draw entities with `MeshComponent`.
*   **Asset Loading:** Implement loading for 3D model formats (e.g., basic OBJ or glTF).
*   **(Later) Physics Debugging & Refinement:**
    *   Resolve `forge2d` build errors (`World.step`, `Body.type`).
    *   Uncomment physics logic.
    *   Implement entity lifecycle handling in `PhysicsSystem`.
    *   Implement physics queries & tests.
*   **Input Refinement:**
    *   Handle scroll events.
    *   Implement gamepad support.
*   **API Design & Refinement:** Solidify the public API.
*   **Testing:** Add more comprehensive tests.
*   **Documentation:** Set up DartDoc generation and write initial docs.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up basic GitHub Actions.
*   **Examples:** Create more examples.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Core Systems Implementation (3D Foundation Started).
*   **State:** Basic 2D rendering, sprite loading, input capture, and input-driven movement are functional. Foundation for 3D rendering (Camera, updated Renderer/System) is in place. Physics integration remains blocked. Ready for 3D mesh implementation or further asset loading.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   **Build Errors:** Unresolved `forge2d` API issues (`World.step`, `Body.type`) block physics implementation. Physics code is disabled.
*   `PhysicsSystem` needs entity lifecycle handling (when unblocked).
*   `Renderer.drawVertices` needs implementation (including matrix transforms).
*   `RenderSystem` needs logic for `MeshComponent`.
*   `MeshComponent` needs definition.
*   `AssetManager` needs support for other types (models, audio, etc.).
*   Input capture on Android emulator might have focus issues.
